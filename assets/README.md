# Overview
Make sure you have Node Version Manager (NVM) installed.

Before you do anything with storybook or yarn, run the following command
```bash
$ nvm use
```
That will make sure you're running the proper version of node for the `node_modules`.

## Creating a new entity

In your terminal run the following command
```bash
$ yarn generate
```
Select which type of entity you want to create. When prompted for a name, you can enter a "Human Readable" name. It will be converted into the proper case and format for Drupal.
